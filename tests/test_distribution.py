    real, governed source repository -- that is a source/release-acceptance
    concern, and this function makes no claim about it either way. A test
    fixture copied by ``copy_repo`` is not that repository: many tests in
    this module deliberately mutate the copy afterward (revision text,
    work-order fixtures, CRLF conversion, and so on), and unrelated ordinary
    churn in the real repository's own governance instance (LOG/PLAN/STATE)
    is expected between sessions. Pinning the real repository's own
    historical hashes against a disposable copy therefore asserts nothing
    about drift in that copy; it just fails on the first incidental byte
    difference between the two, before any test-specific mutation runs.

    This recomputes each retained entry's ``sha256`` from the corresponding
    file exactly as it exists in THIS destination, right now -- before any
    later, test-specific mutation in this module -- and writes only this
    disposable copy's own ``identity/legacy-references.json``. It never
    touches the real, governed source repository's identity file, any other
    real authority or probe-evidence file, or any field on a retained entry
    besides ``sha256`` (path, context, ``projection_sha256``,
    ``projection_transform``, schema, and the ``current``/``former`` blocks
    are preserved verbatim, and no entry is added or removed). Because this
    runs before the mutations below, a genuine identity-negative test that
    later edits a retained file (or an unrelated one) still produces a real,
    detectable mismatch; this only removes the false mismatch that copying
    the repository into a new, disposable location and running other tests
    against it would otherwise introduce on every run. This is controlled
    fixture baseline state for this test module only -- it is never a claim

# `check_distribution.py` performed the equivalent scan only inside
# `check_archive()`, which runs only when `--archive` is supplied. The two
# gates never disagreed about the RULE; they disagreed about WHEN it applies.
# A tree the builder refuses could therefore pass the earlier, cheaper check,
# and the defect surfaced later as a cascade across this suite instead of as
# one legible check failure.
#
# This locks the parity through the PUBLIC interface — the checker command
# with no `--archive` — so a future refactor cannot restore the asymmetry
# while keeping the internals green.

# but it exits 1 with a traceback, so any procedure requiring a temporary
# build outside the repository could not exit zero.

# builder command with an external `--output` -- and asserts in the same run
# that the machine-path gate still refuses, so a reporting repair can never be
# mistaken for, or quietly become, a relaxation of a packaging gate.
