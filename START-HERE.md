# Start here: the human operating guide

You do not need to understand the Doctrine before beginning. You need to know
which role you are talking to, where that agent is running, and what decision
belongs to you.

The safest default is: **run the coordinator, talk to the Architect it names,
and promote the project into adoption only when the idea is ready.** Make the
self-contained `writwall-adopt` bundle local before the wall is registered. The
wall may intentionally deny network access once the project enters lockout; an
agent cannot fetch instructions it does not already have.

## The one canonical lifecycle

Every project follows one canonical lifecycle:

1. **Owner → fresh Architect.** The human brings an idea or an existing
   repository. The Architect begins read-only, listens, inspects bounded local
   evidence, challenges the pitch, and returns a project sketch. The
   conversation has no fixed length and may end without adoption.
2. **Owner promotion → adoption materialization.** Only after the Owner accepts
   the sketch do the local adoption bundle and recorder mechanics create the
   ratified charter, Plan, Routing, State, adoption record, and tested provider
   boundary.
3. **Fresh General → bounded Operators.** Adoption ends the onboarding context.
   A new General maintains continuity and prepares work orders or external
   Operator packets. Operators execute only active bounded work.
4. **Fresh Reviewer → Owner disposition.** A separate Reviewer checks the
   result and record. The Owner accepts, rejects, or ratifies a deviation.

Prompt-only use, the bundled skill, `--structured-intake`, and `init.sh` are
fallback or specialist execution methods inside this lifecycle. They are not
different governance routes.

## Which command do I run?

Point `--project-root` at your project, not the downloaded Writwall distribution.
When you inspect the distribution itself, the coordinator reports
`public_distribution` and asks you to select a target project. Retained
self-hosting records describe the source and do not adopt your checkout.
To discuss contributing to Writwall itself, use `inspect --role architect`
with that checkout as the project root and follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

```text
# New idea or clean project; may create .writwall-bootstrap/
writwall start --project-root /path/to/your-project

# Existing or workplace project; no project or local-state writes
writwall inspect --project-root /path/to/your-project --role architect

# Already adopted project; derive the next safe role from repository bytes
writwall inspect --project-root /path/to/your-project --role auto
```

The command does not launch an agent. It tells you which fresh role to open and
prints the exact prompt to paste. Use `inspect --role architect` when you want
to discuss an existing repository before allowing Writwall to create anything.
Use `start` for a genuinely new project or after you have decided that a
create-only bootstrap is acceptable.

### Using Writwall at work

Use an employer-approved Python environment, AI account, agent interface,
repository location, and data policy. For an existing work repository, run the
no-write `inspect --role architect` command above, then open a fresh approved
agent session with access to the repository and paste the emitted handoff.

If you must begin manually, paste:

```text
Act as the Writwall Architect for this repository. Start read-only. Use the
handoff below, summarize what the repository already shows, listen to my
project pitch, challenge assumptions, and do not materialize adoption or
dispatch work until I explicitly approve the project sketch.
```

After adoption, use the emitted handoff or this short form in a new session:

```text
Act as a fresh Writwall General for this adopted repository. Begin read-only,
verify the governed lifecycle from repository bytes, recommend the next
bounded decision or work order, and do not activate or implement it until I
approve it.
```

Writwall does not override company policy. Do not put secrets, customer data,
private keys, production record values, or credentials into prompts or Writwall
records. Keep infrastructure and account-bearing actions in separately bounded
Operator packets. Only the supplied Claude Code adapter currently provides a
shipped mechanical wall; other agents are instruction-bounded unless an
equivalent adapter is installed and birth-tested.

## Who does what

| Function | Who or what performs it | May share an agent? |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | You. You decide intent, ratify records, authorize lifecycle actions, and accept results. | Never delegated. |
| **Architect** | The fresh agent that listens to the pitch, inventories an existing project, challenges the idea, and returns a project sketch for your promotion decision. It returns later for new design or design-conformance judgment. | May be the same model used later, but not the same running context. |
| **General** | The fresh post-adoption continuity agent that maintains the Plan, prepares bounded dispatch, routes work, and records only decisions you already made. | May perform Dispatcher and recorder mechanics in a fresh turn or session. |
| **Operator / Implementer** | The coding, infrastructure, or other execution agent working under one bounded packet or active work order. | Does not review or authorize its own work. |
| **Reviewer** | A fresh read-only agent given the work order, report, and changed result. | Use a fresh session with no implementation role; a different provider is optional, not required. |

These are functions, not permanent job titles. One model can perform several
functions sequentially for a small project, but it does not carry authority
between them and does not review its own implementation in the same context.

## Pick an operating model

### Small project

Use one capable frontier model sequentially in separate sessions as Architect
and General; use your IDE coding agent as the walled Operator/Implementer; open
a fresh session for Reviewer work. This is the lightest credible arrangement.

Talk first to the Architect outside the walled IDE, or to the IDE agent
**before** any project hook is registered. Give it the public Writwall source
or the complete local adoption bundle.

### Split-role project

Use an external Architect and General (for example general-purpose coding tasks
or chats with repository access), a walled Operator inside the IDE, and a fresh
Reviewer. This is the recommended path when the wall is
already installed, the repository has substantial existing intent, or the IDE
session cannot perform protected lifecycle mechanics.

### Provider-neutral

Use any capable model for Architect, General, Operator, and Reviewer functions.
Without a birth-tested provider adapter, the grants are
instruction-bounded rather than mechanically enforced. The records and review
flow still work; describe the enforcement boundary honestly.

## Normal path: start before the wall is registered

If this is a new project and its public name is not already settled, run the
[inception name-clearance gate](docs/name-clearance.md) before creating package
names, repository slugs, domains, logos, or launch copy. The coordinator may
collect evidence, but the Owner chooses the identity; unavailable sources are
not clear results.

1. Release `v0.11.0` packages the conversation-first Architect handoff,
   canonical-root enforcement, corrected lifecycle classification, and the
   repository-nonmutating `writwall inspect` entry.
   Install it without unpacking it over your project:

   ```text
   python -m pip install "https://github.com/HLLMR/writwall/archive/refs/tags/v0.11.0.zip"
   ```

   Release `v0.9.0` first introduced the coordinator. Release `v0.9.1` corrected
   first-use bytecode residue. Release `v0.9.2` corrects the bootstrap
   expected-denial contract. Release `v0.9.3` adds lifecycle-aware
   routing and the terminal Architect handoff. Release `v0.10.0` adds
   conversation-first inception, corrected adoption-state classification,
   and canonical project-root enforcement.
   Release `v0.11.0` adds the installed, read-only `writwall inspect` entry and
   prospective immutable-release verification.
   If you are testing an unpublished release candidate, use its checked external
   candidate tree and the release gate in `PUBLICATION.md`.
2. Run one command:

   ```text
   # Installed command
   writwall start --project-root /path/to/your-project

   # Source-tree fallback on Windows
   py -3 scripts/start_writwall.py --project-root C:\path\to\your-project

   # Source-tree fallback on macOS or Linux
   python3 scripts/start_writwall.py --project-root /path/to/your-project
   ```

   If you only want to understand or re-enter a project without creating a
   bootstrap, use the read-only interface instead:

   ```text
   # Installed command
   writwall inspect --project-root /path/to/your-project --role auto

   # Source-tree fallback on Windows
   py -3 -B -m writwall_cli inspect --project-root C:\path\to\your-project --role architect

   # Source-tree fallback on macOS or Linux
   python3 -B -m writwall_cli inspect --project-root /path/to/your-project --role architect
   ```

   `--role auto` derives the safe next role from repository lifecycle bytes.
   An explicit `architect`, `general`, or `recovery` selection works only in
   lifecycle states compatible with that role and grants no mutation or
   lifecycle authority. `inspect` writes no bootstrap, project, temporary,
   profile, privacy-screen, cache, or bytecode state. The source-tree fallback
   requires running from an unpacked Writwall source tree; no executable can
   run when neither Writwall nor its source is locally available. Use the
   prompt-only fallback below in that case.

   The same command is the entry point throughout the project lifecycle:

   | Observed state | Fresh role receiving the output | Session that stops | May target bytes change? |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Clean/new (ordinary invocation) | Architect (conversation-first) | The human's current launcher returns after creating the bootstrap; the Architect stops before adoption mechanics until you make an explicit promotion decision | Yes: create-only `.writwall-bootstrap/` |
   | Clean/new (`--structured-intake`) | Fresh Architect (prepared intake) | The human's current launcher returns after creating the bootstrap; the Architect stops before adoption mechanics until you explicitly promote the sketch | Yes: create-only `.writwall-bootstrap/` |
   | Partial bootstrap or recovery | Recovery coordinator | The incomplete adoption or locked session | No |
   | Adopted or retired lockout | Fresh General | The onboarding coordinator or prior work session | No |
   | Active work order | Bounded Operator/Implementer | Any prior coordinator or Implementer context | No |
   | Malformed or contradictory | No role; precise stop diagnostic | The invoking session | No |

   `inspect` follows the same table without the clean/new bootstrap write.
   Explicit Architect inspection is supported for clean/new, partial,
   adopted, and retired states; explicit General only for adopted/retired
   lockout; explicit recovery only for a partial bootstrap. An active work
   order remains routed only to its bounded Operator under `--role auto`.

   **`--brief` (unreleased source work; not part of any published release,
   including `v0.11.0`).** Adding `--brief` to `inspect` prints an opt-in,
   zero-write compact continuation brief instead of the full copy-paste
   prompt: labeled sections (observed evidence, decision/authority
   references, proposals, next permitted step, mandatory evidence, optional
   references), bounded to 500 whitespace-delimited words of prose, followed
   by an unbounded evidence index listing only current, already-existing
   files with real byte sizes or an explicit "not yet materialized" /
   "unresolved" / "excluded" label — never a silent guess. Byte sizes are
   not a token, context, or cost measurement. A work order's own `Routing:`
   line supports one narrow, documented grammar: whole, complete relative
   paths (letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `.`, `/`, ending in an extension, never
   `..` or absolute). A URL, a digest/version-decorated reference (`path@
   sha256:...`), and any path under a read-denied prefix
   (`governance/history/`, `governance/archive/`, `governance/rfis/`,
   `archive/`, `dist/`) are explicit unsupported or excluded forms — always
   pending, never silently resolved or measured. A digest-decorated
   reference stays unverified because no digest verifier exists yet; that
   absence is a stated limitation, never treated as proof the file is
   current or stale. A retired-lockout brief's closed-history evidence is
   limited to the lifecycle classifier's own already-computed aggregate
   count, from a narrowly bounded, header-only read of each top-level
   `governance/history/WO-*.md` record — never a historical path, filename,
   or body. Every brief states plainly that it is an observation snapshot
   and that mandatory evidence and any active grant must be re-read from
   current repository bytes before acting; it never authorizes execution by
   itself. `--brief` is opt-in, not a mandatory onboarding step, and never
   replaces the full charter, active work-order grant, and routed
   requirements — the ordinary full handoff remains the default.

3. For a clean/new target, the ordinary command above is conversation-first:
   it asks nothing on the command line and never blocks on a questionnaire.
   It observes actual repository lifecycle state, creates
   `<project>/.writwall-bootstrap/`, and initializes a durable local privacy
   screen outside the repository, then hands off to a fresh Architect. If
   the target already holds work, the Architect's opening carries a bounded,
   local, non-secret inventory (Git branch, cleanliness, a few recent commit
   subjects, and top-level project-relative names) and asks whether to
   explore that work or start elsewhere; if the target is empty, it opens
   with exactly: "Tell me what you are thinking." Later valid states emit a
   fresh-role prompt without changing target bytes. To use the former full
   questionnaire instead — Owner-time timer, one question at a time, no
   local inventory — add `--structured-intake`; for deterministic,
   non-interactive automation, use `--non-interactive` with its existing
   required flags. Add only private names, codenames, client identifiers, or
   domains; never add credentials or secret values. See
   [`docs/privacy-screen.md`](docs/privacy-screen.md).
4. Open its `HANDOFF.md`. Start the agent and location it names and paste the
   exact prompt. The complete local `writwall-adopt` bundle is already beside
   the handoff.
5. Keep that temporary directory until recorder closeout no longer needs it;
   remove it before the adoption commit. Register and birth-test the wall only
   through the exact lifecycle the coordinator prepares and you ratify.

The command does not install Writwall, interpret intake as ratified intent,
create an activation pointer, contact an external system, or replace the
human Owner, Architect, or General. It stops on contradictory state instead of guessing from prior
chat. See [`docs/day-zero-coordinator.md`](docs/day-zero-coordinator.md) for
the complete contract.
It may start with an unnamed idea; see
[`docs/architect-interview.md`](docs/architect-interview.md) for qualification,
identity, topology, and role-packet behavior.

### Manual fallback

If Python is unavailable, copy the complete `skills/writwall-adopt/` directory
into a temporary project-local location before registering any wall, confirm
it is readable, then use the prompt below. For Claude Code, a temporary
`.claude/skills/writwall-adopt/` location is supported. Keep the bundle until
the final authorized recorder action that needs it and remove it before the
adoption commit.

Paste this first:

```text
Act as the Writwall Architect for this repository. Start read-only. Use the
local writwall-adopt bundle for reference, summarize what the repository
already shows, listen to my pitch, challenge assumptions, and return a concise
project sketch. Do not begin adoption mechanics until I explicitly promote the
sketch. If I promote it, switch only to the bundle's bootstrap procedure; I
decide and ratify, and an authorized recorder may perform the clerical steps.
Do not install or register the wall until the complete bundle and recovery
instructions are locally available. Do not begin product work until adoption
is complete and a fresh General has taken over.
```

Only after you explicitly promote the Architect's sketch, the manual
continuation may begin:

```text
Act as my Writwall adoption coordinator, not as an Implementer. Use the local
writwall-adopt bundle and follow its bootstrap mode. I decide and ratify; you
may perform only the separately authorized recorder mechanics. Do not begin
product work or continue as the General.
```

## If the archive was already unpacked into your project

Stop before deleting or continuing. Do not assume every Writwall-looking file
is disposable: an existing project may already have a `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.github/`, `checks/`, or governance material of its own.

Use a separate clean Writwall distribution and an external coordinator to
inventory the overlay. Compare candidate files with that clean distribution's
`PROJECTION-MANIFEST.sha256`; treat byte-identical matches only as proposed
overlay residue, and treat every differing or pre-existing path as unknown.
The coordinator proposes an exact keep/remove/move disposition. You ratify it;
an authorized recorder may then perform those exact mechanics. Never run a
blanket delete or unpack a second archive over the first.

Paste this recovery prompt:

```text
Act as my Writwall accidental-overlay recovery coordinator. Inventory only;
do not delete, overwrite, move, install, or register anything. Compare this
project against a separate clean Writwall distribution and its manifest.
Classify exact matches as proposed overlay residue and every differing or
pre-existing path as unknown. Give me an exact disposition packet and ask one
question at a time. Do not begin adoption until I ratify the recovery packet.
```

If your coding agent supports skills, the shorter invocation is:

```text
Use the writwall-adopt skill. Bootstrap this repository for Doctrine 0.8
adoption. Baseline commit candidate: determine and propose. Ask one question at
a time and do not begin product work.
```

## Recovery path: already-installed lockout

If `.claude/active-wo.txt` is absent and the wall denies mutation or network
access, **stop using that session as the coordinator**. That session is behaving
as a walled Implementer in lockout. Do not weaken the hook, invent a pointer, or
ask it to fetch missing instructions.

Open an external coordinator / recorder with access to the target repository
and the downloaded Writwall source, then paste:

```text
Act as my Writwall adoption coordinator for an already-installed lockout, not
as the walled Implementer. The target has a registered wall and no active-work-
order pointer. Use the local public Writwall source; do not ask the locked
session to fetch it or bypass the wall. Inventory the incomplete adoption,
prepare the exact birth-test and recorder lifecycle packets, and ask me one
question at a time in plain language. I ratify decisions; after exact
ratification, first record my authorization verbatim in the packet's named
durable lifecycle record and verify it. Only then perform the protected
repository mechanics named in that record on my behalf. Do not probe any
external service unless I have named a disposable target and cleanup authority
in advance. Do not begin WO-001.
```

An authorized lifecycle action may remove a pointer and re-establish the no-
pointer state for a fresh Level 1 session. The condition is not a one-time
window. Unplanned denials remain honest log evidence, but unplanned denials are
not retroactively promoted into a birth test.

## Make the birth test safe

Before registering the wall or starting Level 1, confirm the provider's
engine-visible pre-adoption charter contains the complete text of
`assets/bootstrap-charter-addendum.md` from the local adoption bundle. That temporary
rule resolves the bootstrap boundary without weakening it: ordinary no-pointer
work remains forbidden, while exact calls named by a durably Owner-ratified
birth-test lifecycle may be dispatched solely so the wall can deny them. The
attempt confers no mutation authority; denial is the only valid outcome, and
any success stops adoption. Remove the addendum before the adoption commit.

Start with a **minimal provider profile**. Disable unrelated plugins,
connectors, MCP servers, and delegated agents before inventorying the mutation
surface. If an external mutation tool must remain available, test it only when
the lifecycle packet names an **explicit disposable fixture**, expected side
effect, verification method, and cleanup authority.

Never aim a first-run probe at ordinary Drive, Notion, Figma, email, calendar,
deployment, or production objects. Authentication failure, provider rejection
before hook dispatch, an unavailable tool, or an unprobed channel is
**indeterminate, never a pass**. Reduce the active surface or retain the honest
unenforced classification.

The human may need to perform genuinely interactive provider actions such as
viewing Claude Code's `/hooks`, completing authentication, or privately creating
a read-deny sentinel. Those are exceptions. File creation, pointer changes,
validation, Git mechanics, and recorder closeout are not automatically human
chores; an exactly authorized recorder may perform them.

## Recorder closeout prompt

After the coordinator presents the exact decision and lifecycle packet and you
agree with every substantive decision, ratify that exact packet. Then say:

```text
Enter writwall-adopt recorder closeout mode. Record only the exact packet I
ratified. First durably record this authorization in the packet's named
lifecycle record and verify it; a chat exchange alone is not lifecycle authorization.
Then perform the authorized clerical operations and local
adoption commit on my behalf; do not infer or improve my decisions. Remove the
temporary bootstrap bundle before the adoption commit, return the project to
lockout, and do not dispatch WO-001.
```

## Terminal General handoff

Earlier releases labeled this continuity handoff `Owner-Agent / Project-Architect`;
that term is retained only as compatibility vocabulary for older records.

Adoption closeout ends the onboarding session. After the adoption commit, open
a fresh General and paste exactly:

```text
Act as a fresh General for this already-adopted project's continuity. Begin
read-only and verify the lifecycle from repository bytes rather than prior chat. Read the
charter, Plan, State, Routing, ratified adoption record, and open transactional records. State
the project's next decision plainly. Prepare, but do not activate, the smallest genuine work
order or bounded Operator packet; route it to a fresh Architect instead only when the next
decision requires new design or design-conformance judgment rather than routine continuity. Lead
with a concise Recommendation and material tradeoff; keep the detailed packet behind it as
supporting evidence rather than the conversational front door. When the next safe mechanical
action is available, ask once for one combined disposition and action. If that action uses a new
user-owned task, explicitly include creation and dispatch of the named task in that approval
request; never infer task-creation permission afterward. Carry that approval's continuity in the
shared Authorization section below, transcribed from an already-authorized current record rather
than retyped or re-approved by the Owner.

## Authorization

- Approval source/reference: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Approved action: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Exact scope: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Exclusions: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Delegation permission: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Lifecycle conditions: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record
- Completion boundary: unknown: not yet transcribed from an already-authorized record

This section carries forward evidence of a decision already made elsewhere;
it is not itself a decision, and it never substitutes for an independent
provider authorization. A field populated above transcribes that
already-authorized record's own reference and wording; the human Owner never
retypes or re-approves it. A field left unknown above means the preparer has
not yet located it in an already-authorized current record; the preparer
inspects those records before asking anyone. Only a genuinely missing, materially necessary decision is a question for the Owner; the absence of optional or formal metadata is not itself an approval loop, and an existing valid legacy approval remains usable without new paperwork.

Matching current approval: performs the already-authorized action once the provider itself permits it.
Missing approval: says plainly that authorization is missing and stops.
Explicit revocation or supersession: treats a revoked or superseded record as no longer authorizing anything.
Requested action beyond scope: performs only the authorized part and names the excess as unauthorized.
Independent provider denial: reports the provider's own denial as the exact blocker.
Environment prerequisite failure: names the exact missing or failed environment prerequisite as the blocker.
Unapproved task creation or data transmission: never creates or transmits a task, message, or dataset outside the approved action.

Once approved, perform every
mechanically available authorized step. Do not ask for the same decision again. The human Owner
alone ratifies intent and activates work; preserve a distinct fresh Reviewer after
implementation. The onboarding coordinator stops here and does not continue into project work.
```

The Authorization section above is filled in by the General itself from
already-approved current records, or an equivalent legacy record's existing
scope and authority; you are never asked to retype or re-approve values that
already exist, and a blank field alone is not a new approval service or a
performance claim.

The General leads with a concise recommendation and material tradeoff; its
detailed packet remains supporting evidence. If the next safe step can be done,
its one approval request includes both the disposition and that action. Creating
a new user-owned task must be explicitly included in that request. Once you
approve it, the General performs every authorized mechanical step available
without asking the same question again. It still does not infer ratification,
activate a work order it was told only to prepare, or implement product work.
It routes new design and design-conformance decisions back to a fresh Architect.

After you separately approve and activate a work order, start a fresh Implementer:

```text
Act as a fresh Implementer for the active work order only. Confirm the active dispatch
and required live-wall canary before mutation. Execute the order, preserve RED
and GREEN evidence, write its report, and stop before acceptance or closeout.
```

For review, start a fresh session:

```text
Act as a read-only Reviewer. Review the active work order, implementation diff,
test evidence, and report for conformance and record truth. Do not implement a
fix. Return ACCEPT or specific findings with severity and evidence.
```

The complete adoption contract, artifact sequence, and provider-specific birth
test details are in [ADOPTING.md](ADOPTING.md). Read those after choosing the
operating model above.
