# Proposed-status detection (RFI-14)
#
# A governed document declares its own status in one of two places: a
# top-level `status:` field in its opening frontmatter, or an explicit
# human-readable marker line near the top of the body.
#
# The earlier gate matched exactly one literal, `Status: PROPOSED`, inside a
# fixed 40-line window. Ordinary lowercase frontmatter, a quoted value, a
# different capitalization, and a frontmatter block longer than the window all
# evaded it, so a draft could reach an adopted archive. Detection is therefore
# semantic rather than literal:
#
#   * the complete opening frontmatter block is parsed, however long it is, so
#     no field position can hide from a window;
#   * a top-level `status:` field there is AUTHORITATIVE. A record declaring
#     ISSUED, ACTIVE, COMPLETE, RATIFIED, or RFI-BLOCKED is final even when its
#     body quotes the PROPOSED language it carried while it was a draft. That
#     quotation is history, not a status declaration, and a completed record
#     must not be forced to redact its own drafting history to ship;
#   * only when no such field exists does the bounded body scan apply, and it
#     matches a line that DECLARES a status rather than prose mentioning the
#     words "status" and "proposed". The line must begin with `status:` once
#     Markdown heading, emphasis, block-quote, and code decoration is stripped.
#
# This block is mirrored verbatim in scripts/build_distribution.py. The
# builder and the checker must agree on every document or the gate is theatre.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Source-mode machine-path parity (RFI-23)
#
# `scripts/build_distribution.py` refuses to package a source tree whose
# packageable text artifacts name this machine's own repository root or user
# home. The equivalent scan here lived only inside `check_archive()`, which
# runs only when `--archive` is supplied, so a source-mode run performed no
# machine-path scan at all.
#
# The two gates never disagreed about the RULE. They disagreed about WHEN it
# is applied: the builder to the source tree, the checker only to a built
# archive. "Source check passes" was therefore not equivalent to "source tree
# is buildable", and the defect surfaced later as a build refusal cascading
# across the test suite rather than as one legible check failure.
#
# The rule itself is NOT restated here. The packageable file set, the needle
# definition, and the scanned suffixes are all read from the builder, so there
# is exactly one definition of machine-specific data in the repository and a
# change to it cannot leave the two gates disagreeing again.
#
# Only the REPORTING differs, and it must: the builder raises on the first
# offending set because it is refusing to produce a candidate, while this
# checker aggregates every failure across every category before exiting. That
# is why this is a loop here rather than a direct call to the builder's
# `machine_path_preflight()`, which raises SystemExit and would abandon the
# remaining checks.
