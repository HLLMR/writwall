# PLAN — Plumbline

**Status: RATIFIED by the Owner (HLLMR) on 2026-08-16**, for the self-adoption and 10-work-order pilot.

Scope: the **repository-development role**. Root `decisions/DR-001.md` is Plan for the distinct **methodology-source role** and ratifies Doctrine 0.6. The two do not overlap (adoption mapping, 2026-08-16).

This is should-be. As-is lives in `STATE.md`. The difference between them is drift (Doctrine 3.2.2). Amended only by ratification (7.9.1).

---

## 1. What this project is

Plumbline is a document-controlled governance methodology with a self-hosting reference implementation and project-scaffolding toolkit.

Three roles are held apart deliberately: `DOCTRINE.md` is the methodology; this repository is its distribution and reference implementation; a project-local instantiation is a governance system (5.1.2, 5.1.4).

## 2. Ratified intent inherited from the methodology decision

From `decisions/DR-001.md` (2026-08-16):

- Doctrine revision 0.6 is the first authoritative revision of the methodology.
- Revision 0.1 was a proposal only and is not a prior ratified revision.
- Ratification does not represent the methodology as empirically proven, complete, or final. It establishes the baseline needed to run governed pilots, collect real examples, measure failures and recovery costs under Part 9, and revise from evidence.

That third clause is this project's purpose in the Owner's own words.

## 3. Current phase

**Public-gate remediation before the Owner publication decision.** The repository has been governed by
Doctrine 0.6 since adoption commit
`8d5b2b3668ef626525e57028ac09661e17d44edc` (6.1.1). Self-adoption and all ten
counted maintenance work orders are complete. The Doctrine 9.3.1 fresh-agent
evaluation is complete and the Owner ratified `governance/decisions/DR-002.md`:
retain 0.6 provisionally. WO-PL-017 repaired the accepted blocking findings and
closed after fresh review. The Owner completed the licensing preconditions and
ratified DR-003; WO-PL-018 completed the disclosure and license-record boundary.
WO-PL-019 completed license mechanization and distribution integration after
fresh review and Owner disposition. WO-PL-020 completed the checked,
positive-allowlist clean-history projection gate after ACCEPT/HIGH fresh review
and Owner disposition. WO-PL-021 completed the Owner-ratified Doctrine 0.7
template/validator-alignment package after final Reviewer return and Owner
acceptance on 2026-08-21. Plumbline's repository-local governance instance
remains bound to Doctrine 0.6. WO-PL-022 completed the public projection
documentation-truth gate after final Reviewer ACCEPT/HIGH and Owner acceptance
on 2026-08-21. No publication, public Git repository, or visibility change has
occurred.

Owner amendment, 2026-08-20: the Owner ratified the Doctrine 0.7
template/validator-alignment package and queued WO-PL-021 followed by
WO-PL-022. These are blocking public-gate remediations. They do not authorize
publication, a public repository, a visibility change, a tag, a push, a
checked-in `dist/` replacement, or access to another project.

Owner amendment, 2026-08-18: this section was corrected after WO-PL-007 exposed
that its pre-adoption wording had remained in a routed authority after adoption.
The amendment changes current phase only; the pilot objective and evaluation
boundary below are unchanged.

## 4. Pilot subject

**The 10-work-order pilot runs on Plumbline itself.**

One adopting project is **not part of this pilot**. It separately adopted
Plumbline under its own Owner decision, adoption boundary, governance records,
metrics, and fresh-agent evaluation. None of those measurements count toward
Plumbline's 10-work-order pilot.

Owner amendment, 2026-08-19: that project's completed fresh-agent evaluation
identified a generic distribution defect relevant to every adopter that
protects a private read surface: the work-order template declares
`filesystem.read.deny`, while the Claude Code adapter then passed file-reading
tools through and did not enforce that declaration. The Owner authorized one
bounded, test-first Plumbline maintenance order to add and birth-test the
generic capability before the adopter installed it. This was genuine adapter
maintenance, not pooled pilot evidence or product work in the adopter. All
repository metrics remain separate.

**Evidence is never combined across repositories.** A measurement taken in one governed project says nothing about another, and pooling them would manufacture a sample that does not exist.

## 5. Phase target

The current phase completes when all seven are done, in order:

1. Complete Plumbline self-adoption.
2. Execute 10 genuine counted maintenance work orders.
3. Collect Part 9 measurements and evidence-backed examples.
4. Perform the fresh-agent pilot evaluation (9.3.1).
5. Decide whether to retain 0.6, amend the Doctrine, or retire a failed control.
6. Decide licensing.
7. Publish, only when the evidence and licensing gates are both satisfied.

**Revision 0.6 is not "done" merely because adoption succeeds.** Its evaluation boundary is completion of the 10-work-order pilot and the resulting Owner disposition. Adoption is the start of the measurement, not the result.

The boundary was reached on 2026-08-20. The evaluation falsified the one-cycle
recovery-cost prediction, preserved the no-archaeology result, and found that
the strict mechanically-enforced-surface stop rule had no domain during the
pilot. These are retained findings under 9.3.2, not retroactive edits to the
experiment. DR-002 governs the post-pilot disposition.

Step 2 says *genuine* maintenance work orders. Work invented to exercise the methodology is not evidence about the methodology (6.1.4, 3.2.7).

## 6. Falsification and stop rules

The doctrine makes falsifiable claims (9.1.1). These are the conditions under which this project stops rather than continues.

**Pilot pauses immediately when:**

1. **Any successful out-of-grant mutation occurs through a surface represented as mechanically enforced.** The pilot pauses until that surface is either reclassified as unenforced-by-declaration or fixed and birth-tested again. A wall that lets something through was never a wall for that channel (8.3.3, 8.3.4).
2. **Ratified intent changes without explicit Owner ratification.** The affected work is invalidated and the pilot pauses. Authority has a chain of custody or it has nothing (3.2.5, 7.9.1).
3. **An ordinary agent receives archived authority without the explicit authorization Doctrine 8.6.2 requires.** That is a control failure, not an inconvenience, and it pauses the pilot.

**Recorded, not concealed:**

4. A failed prediction is recorded as a finding. It causes revision rather than concealment (9.3.2). A prediction that fails and is quietly dropped would make the whole exercise ceremonial.

**Grounds for retirement:**

5. **Repetition of the same core control failure after one explicitly corrective revision** is grounds for the Owner to retire that control, or the methodology, rather than continue ceremonial compliance. One failure is a finding; the same failure twice after a fix aimed at it is evidence the control does not work.

## 7. Build only what evidence forces

There is no `plumbline validate`, no `plumbline diff`, no dashboard, and no multi-provider enforcement system. Each is worth building only if pilot data shows the manual version costs more than the tool would. Ratification explicitly rejected waiting for a platform (`decisions/DR-001.md`, rejected alternative 3).

The `filesystem.read.deny` adapter capability authorized above is not a new
platform or provider layer. It closes a mismatch between an already-distributed
grant field and the adapter's actual coverage, using the existing hook and
provider tool inventory. Shell-mediated reads remain unenforced unless the work
order denies shell execution; documentation and birth tests must state that
boundary exactly.

## 8. Standing constraints

Restated because `PLAN.md` is the authority a work order is checked against.

- The kill list in `CLAUDE.md` A.1.4 binds, in full.
- No adoption route may carry this repository's own governance records into an adopting project (5.1.5).
- The distribution archive is a source distribution, not an overlay.
- The finalized governance instance ships in the source distribution; unratified governance drafts never do, and a build fails rather than ship a partially adopted state (Owner disposition, 2026-08-16).
- Enforcement claims must match observed behavior. A provider gap is recorded, never described as a wall (8.3.4).
- Templates and bundled copies never drift from their canonical sources; this is checked, not assumed.
- Bootstrap work orders and remediation reports are pre-adoption evidence. They are never represented as counted or retroactively governed, and are not moved into live `governance/history/`.
- No agent ratifies intent, signs a decision, or changes an adoption boundary.

## 9. Owner-queued successor sequence — 2026-08-19

This section queues work; it activates nothing. Every work order still requires
an issue-time baseline, complete machine-readable manifest, pointer, applicable
provider-envelope wall proof, and separate Owner dispatch. A provider that
cannot be governed by the installed wall records that gap rather than simulating
a canary. The phase order in section 5 is unchanged.

1. **WO-PL-014 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** The deterministic
   pre-dispatch validator consolidated the three
   separately retained findings routed through RFI-25, RFI-27, and RFI-28. The
   validator is justified only if its bounded design catches pointer identity,
   line endings, grant/frontmatter consistency, residue, and issue-time path
   validity more cheaply than the manual dispatch corrections now recorded.
   Fresh review returned two implementation cycles before ACCEPT/HIGH closeout.
   RFI-25, RFI-27, and RFI-28 are resolved separately under bounded residuals.
2. **WO-PL-015 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** Source, builder, and archive
   modes now refuse an activation pointer or any regular file in the two live
   work directories before release output. Fresh review returned three
   correction cycles before ACCEPT/HIGH; final Windows and Ubuntu suites each
   passed 356 tests. **WO-PL-016 remains evidence-selected maintenance.** Use
   the final counted pilot position only for genuine maintenance taught by the
   repository's observed operation; do not invent work merely to complete the
   count.
3. **WO-PL-016 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** The portable adopter
   pre-dispatch validator now travels through both supported adoption routes,
   create-only and byte-identical, with generic identifier support and bundle
   gates. Fresh review required three correction cycles; final Windows and
   Ubuntu suites each passed 372 tests. This completes the ten counted work
   orders.
4. **Pilot evaluation and Owner disposition — COMPLETE, 2026-08-20.** The
   fresh Opus evaluation and Codex verification informed ratified DR-002.
   Doctrine 0.6 is retained provisionally; no control is retired; the adverse
   findings are publication obligations rather than hidden cleanup.
5. **WO-PL-017 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** Complete Appendix B manifests
   now fail closed; current derived records and routing materialization are
   corrected; prospective cost and Reviewer-independence rules are recorded.
   Fresh review required two correction returns before ACCEPT/HIGH. This is
   post-pilot work and adds no counted row.
6. **Owner licensing preconditions.** Outside the repository, confirm chain of
   title and obtain any desired employment, license, or naming review. Then the
   Owner may ratify a Plumbline-only licensing decision. A draft decision is not
   authority and is not stored in the packageable source tree.
7. **WO-PL-018 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** Applied the
   Owner-controlled private disclosure manifest to the live files eligible for
   public projection, place canonical unmodified license texts, and create the
   human-readable license, naming, contribution, and bundle maps. Sensitive
   matched text and second-project internals never enter a work order, report,
   decision, log, or commit message.
8. **WO-PL-019 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** Added SPDX/REUSE metadata,
   a standard-library license checker, tests, and distribution-gate
   integration. Fresh review ended CONDITIONAL ACCEPT/HIGH; the Owner accepted
   the disclosed deviations and required the deferred post-closeout archive
   gate to pass before the local closeout commit.
9. **WO-PL-020 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-20.** Built and verified a
   positive-allowlist release candidate outside this repository. The candidate
   contains no inherited Git objects, private governance history, pre-adoption
   archive, stale distribution artifact, or private disclosure manifest. Fresh
   review ended ACCEPT/HIGH; the Owner accepted four disclosed deviations.
10. **WO-PL-021 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-21.** Materialized the
    Owner-ratified Doctrine 0.7 Appendix B alignment: declared grant surfaces
    are classified, generated boundaries and the adopter workflow are present,
    canonical and bundled copies agree, the 0.6-to-0.7 migration guide exists,
    and the amended Windows, Ubuntu, distribution, license, projection, and
    fresh-review gates passed. Plumbline's repository-local governance instance
    remains bound to Doctrine 0.6 unless the Owner separately ratifies a
    project-side migration under DC.4.
11. **WO-PL-022 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-08-21.** Corrected the public
    projection's repository-inventory and evidence-scope claims; foregrounded
    that WO-PL-017 through WO-PL-020 ran on Codex outside the Claude hook and
    were instruction-bounded; preserved legitimate normative adopter-path
    language; added a public-safe Plumbline self-hosting pilot example using
    only Plumbline's aggregate evidence; made the documentation-truth rule
    executable; passed full Windows and two real native-Ubuntu candidate
    suites; obtained final Reviewer ACCEPT/HIGH; and recorded 12 actual Owner
    active minutes.
12. **Owner publication decision.** Publication uses a new public repository
   with a fresh root commit derived from the accepted projection. This governed
   evidence repository remains private; changing its visibility is not the
   publication mechanism.

The durable private drafts retain their old proposal identifiers until they are
reconciled before issue. They are not authority, are not imported into this
repository, and WO-PL-017 does not open them.

The checked-in `dist/` archive is not a publication candidate. It remains stale
and private until the disclosure, licensing, mechanization, and projection
gates above have all passed. No queued item changes repository visibility,
publishes, pushes, or selects a license by itself.

## 10. Owner-ratified public-gate remediation sequence — 2026-08-21

Owner disposition, 2026-08-21: the Owner approved the following three bounded
work orders and authorized Doctrine 0.8 drafting under WO-PL-023. This
amendment records that disposition; it does not ratify Doctrine 0.8 text in
advance. The exact candidate revision returns to the Owner for a separate
ratification decision before any normative adapter implementation depends on
it.

1. **WO-PL-023 — Doctrine 0.8 and adopter contract.** Prepare an
   Owner-ratifiable Doctrine revision and methodology decision resolving the
   Appendix A enforcement overclaim, duplicate Appendix B numbering, adoption
   footprint conflict, bootstrap-work-order conflict, and protected
   control-plane semantics. Repair the adopter instructions, canonical birth
   test, pointer and prose-exception documentation, route-footprint claims,
   templates, skill assets, repository inventory, and public-projection
   retained-reference integrity. Ratified Doctrine 0.7 is not silently edited
   in place: candidate semantics return to the Owner first.
2. **WO-PL-024 — Capability-wall hardening and portability.** After the
   Doctrine 0.8 semantics are ratified, implement the protected control-plane
   floor; require ACTIVE lifecycle status; reject root-resolving or
   symlink-widened grants; establish parser equivalence or a shared
   deterministic contract; classify network tools truthfully; provide
   platform-aware startup, preflight, and timeout behavior; declare supported
   Python versions; repair the Windows test harness; add CI; run fresh Windows
   and native-POSIX birth tests; and resolve or dispose RFI-22.
3. **WO-PL-025 — Verification-only public release candidate.** Make no feature
   changes. Build reproducible clean projections; run the retained-reference,
   distribution, license, Windows, native-Ubuntu, and cold end-to-end adoption
   gates; obtain a fresh independent review; and return a separate Owner
   publication decision.

This sequence does not authorize publication, a public repository, a push, a
tag, a visibility change, replacement of checked-in `dist/`, or publication of
this governed source repository. A future public release, if separately
authorized after WO-PL-025, uses a clean projection in a new repository with a
fresh root commit.

## 11. Owner-ratified sequencing correction — 2026-08-21

This section supersedes only the uncompleted identifiers and sequence in
section 10; it preserves WO-PL-023 and the original queue as historical intent.
WO-PL-024 was prematurely activated under this project's still-operative 0.6
binding, received no implementation or test work, and was disposed **VOID
BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**. Its identifier is consumed permanently and is not
reused.

The remaining queue is:

1. **WO-PL-025 — Project-local migration from Doctrine 0.6 directly to 0.8.**
   Prepare one cumulative DC.4 migration decision naming both revisions and
   every affected project artifact; incorporate the 0.6-to-0.7 and 0.7-to-0.8
   transitions without representing 0.7 as a separately active project
   binding; return the exact decision and work order for Owner ratification;
   and only after ratification materialize and verify the project-local
   charter, templates, binding record, dispatch contract, and observed State.
2. **WO-PL-026 — Capability-wall hardening and portability.** Perform the
   scope formerly queued as WO-PL-024: implement the protected control-plane
   floor; require ACTIVE lifecycle status; reject root-resolving or
   symlink-widened grants; establish parser equivalence or a shared
   deterministic contract; classify network tools truthfully; provide
   platform-aware startup, preflight, and timeout behavior; declare supported
   Python versions; repair the Windows test harness; add CI; run fresh Windows
   and native-POSIX birth tests; and resolve or dispose RFI-22.
3. **WO-PL-027 — Verification-only public release candidate.** Perform the
   scope formerly queued as WO-PL-025 without feature changes: build
   reproducible clean projections; run retained-reference, distribution,
   license, Windows, native-Ubuntu, and cold end-to-end adoption gates; obtain
   fresh independent review; and return a separate Owner publication decision.

This correction authorizes recovery accounting and preparation of the exact
WO-PL-025 migration package for Owner ratification. It does not ratify that
migration package in advance, activate or implement WO-PL-025, implement wall
hardening, activate WO-PL-026 or WO-PL-027, publish, replace `dist/`, tag, or
change repository visibility.

## 12. Owner-ratified post-publication polish — 2026-08-28

Plumbline 0.8 is publicly released from the accepted clean-history projection.
The Owner authorizes one concentrated front-door polish order, WO-PL-034, to
add an original README banner, concise GitHub status/navigation chrome, and a
short evidence-backed mechanism demonstration; carry the asset through the
existing license and projection machinery; and correct the private State's
observed publication status. This work may improve presentation and access to
existing evidence, but it may not enlarge enforcement, effectiveness, pilot,
provider, or operating-cost claims or revise Doctrine 0.8.

## 13. Owner-ratified first-adopter repair — 2026-08-28

The Owner authorized WO-PL-035 after the first clean public adoption exposed a
human-ramp defect: the wall locked down correctly, but the novice did not have
an executable coordinator-first path. WO-PL-035 is complete and accepted. It
delivered a human-first start page, exact prompts, safe lockout and overlay
recovery, external-fixture boundaries, and a public issue-to-PR workflow.

## 14. Owner-ratified naming correction and public case study — 2026-08-28

The Owner directs an emergency pre-promotion naming tranche after discovering
that the public release had never passed an inception name-clearance gate and
that earlier same-category and adjacent AI-agent tools already use `Plumbline`
or `plumb`. Tuesday promotion is frozen until this tranche is complete.

1. **WO-PL-036 — Name-clearance evidence and replacement selection.** Build a
   small deterministic collector/checker contract that records exact queries,
   source availability, timestamps, response evidence, category overlap, and
   Owner disposition across GitHub, major package registries, domain/RDAP,
   common-law web use, and federal trademark records. Use the incident and
   rejected replacement candidates as public evidence. Automated output is not
   a legal opinion. Return a short screened candidate set and one recommendation
   for Owner ratification.
2. **WO-PL-037 — Controlled identity migration.** Only after the Owner ratifies
   a replacement, migrate current product, documentation, code identifiers,
   package/repository references, public assets, launch copy, and release
   surfaces. Preserve old names in historical records and explicit provenance;
   do not rewrite history or imply the replacement name existed earlier.

The current public repository and release remain available as evidence, but no
new promotion, Show HN submission, replacement release, tag, or mass rebrand is
authorized before WO-PL-036 produces and the Owner ratifies the replacement
disposition. Public issue #2 is the durable public defect record.

## 15. Owner-ratified first-use and identity follow-through — 2026-08-29

The Owner accepted **Writwall** as the canonical identity, directed retirement
of the inherited plumb-line device in favor of the already-developed two-line
wall glyph, and confirmed that an IDE coding agent is a valid day-zero entry
point before the wall is registered. The first public adoption showed that the
role architecture exists but the invocation contract still fails when the wall
is installed before its bootstrap bundle and local handoff are available.

1. **WO-PL-038 — Wall-glyph identity correction.** Replace the current-use
   plumb-line device in public README/social assets with the two-line wall at
   the `writ|wall` boundary. Preserve explicit historical evidence; do not
   rewrite accepted records. Verify generated raster siblings, projection and
   license gates, and finish public issue #2 through the ordinary projection
   and pull-request path after acceptance.
2. **WO-PL-039 — Cache-safe public identity and repository hardening.**
   Correct the GitHub delivery failure recorded in public issue #4: publish
   the accepted README banner under a content-versioned path, prevent future
   current-use visual replacements from reusing a published URL, refresh the
   repository social preview, pin CI actions, establish one stable required
   check, and enable proportionate public-repository protections. This bounded
   correction precedes rather than expands the coordinator build.
3. **WO-PL-040 — Day-zero invocation and bootstrap handoff.** Make the
   IDE-first path executable from a clean repository: give the human one exact
   kickoff prompt; make the complete bootstrap bundle and a project-local
   handoff readable before wall registration; distinguish the temporary
   bootstrap coordinator from the post-adoption walled Operator; document the
   external infrastructure-operator boundary; and prove the path with a fresh
   clean-context walkthrough. Public issue #1 remains the durable defect
   record. The coordinator must explain and optionally time Owner active
   minutes: human reading, deciding, responding, authentication, and
   unavoidable UI work count; agent execution and waiting do not.

The Owner remains the source of intent and acceptance. The Owner-Agent may
draft, coordinate, record ratified decisions, and perform authorized lifecycle
mechanics. An IDE agent may serve as the bootstrap coordinator before
registration and later as the walled Operator, but those are sequential roles,
not simultaneous authority. An infrastructure agent that only changes DNS,
containers, hosts, or proxies is outside the repository's capability wall; it
receives a bounded external-operations packet and returns evidence. If it edits
repository bytes, it enters the repository as an Operator under a work order.

## 16. Writwall-native series and architect interview — 2026-08-29

The Owner corrected the post-migration identifier boundary before issuing the
next order. `WO-PL-001` through `WO-PL-040` remain immutable identifiers in the
historical Plumbline series. Current Writwall work begins at `WO-WW-001` and
increments within that series. No historical record is renamed or renumbered.

1. **WO-WW-001 — Architect interview and inception evidence.** Extend the
   accepted day-zero coordinator into the promised “I have an idea” front
   door. Qualify the idea before treating it as a project; capture the problem,
   intended user, value, evidence, constraints, risks, success and stop
   conditions; inventory the human/agent/operator environment; recommend the
   smallest credible role topology; and emit bounded setup packets. A public
   identity remains a working candidate until the existing evidenced
   name-clearance process and explicit Owner disposition complete. Name
   research therefore precedes repository/package/domain/logo/launch identity,
   not follows it. The deterministic CLI may collect, validate, package, and
   route intake; a frontier Owner-Agent performs the adaptive architect
   interview. It must not silently install extensions, modify IDE or host
   configuration, access credentials, mutate external systems, ratify intent,
   or begin implementation.

2. **WO-WW-002 — COMPLETE: deterministic build-backend provisioning and release
   recovery.** Corrected the release-blocking ambient-tool assumption exposed by
   public PR #9. CI must provision the build backend declared by
   `pyproject.toml` before running the isolated-install tests; contributor
   instructions must distinguish the build/test prerequisite from Writwall's
   dependency-free runtime. An executable regression must bind CI setup to the
   declared backend requirement. After private acceptance and closeout, rebuild
   the public projection, update PR #9, and require the complete protected CI
   matrix must pass before the PR is merge-ready. Do not patch the public branch
   around governed source, weaken the isolated-install test, add a runtime
   dependency, merge, release, tag, deploy, or change visibility.

3. **WO-WW-003 — COMPLETE: retained-identity ledger refresh and PR #9
   recovery.** Refreshed only the canonical source/projection digests for public retained paths changed
   by accepted WO-WW-002. Prove the identity checker rejects the stale ledger,
   then passes with final closed bytes. Rebuild two complete public candidates,
   require checker-clean byte identity, update PR #9 only from that projection,
   and require protected CI to pass. Do not weaken identity checks, alter retained
   classifications, merge, release, tag, deploy, change visibility, or begin a
   successor.

4. **WO-WW-004 — COMPLETE: managed day-zero privacy screening.** Replaced the
   manual absolute-path private-pattern-file ritual with a durable OS-local,
   repository-external profile created by `writwall start`, keyed to the
   canonical project root, and consumed automatically by projection build and
   check commands. The compatibility override remains; normal commands expose
   no profile paths, values, matches, or value-derived hashes and candidate
   cleanup preserves the durable profile. Link redirection, concurrent update,
   command-argument disclosure, obvious credential-shaped input, absent/empty
   state, and POSIX permissions have executable coverage. Windows passed 715
   tests with two skips; two 131-file no-path candidates were checker-clean and
   byte-identical; corrected fresh review returned ACCEPT. Public issue #10 is
   the defect record and proceeds through a post-closeout projection PR. GitHub
   Actions runtime maintenance remains separately tracked by issue #11.

5. **WO-WW-005 — COMPLETE: GitHub Actions Node 24 refresh.** Replaced the exact
   full-SHA checkout v4 and setup-python v5 pins with verified official
   Node-24-native `v7.0.1` and `v7.0.0` releases. The 3-OS by 5-Python matrix,
   full-history checkout, read-only permissions, declared build-backend
   provisioning, focused/full test split, and stable `CI required` check remain
   unchanged and executable-test protected. Windows passed 715 tests with two
   skips; corrected fresh record review returned ACCEPT. Public issue #11 is
   the defect record and proceeds through the authorized post-closeout
   projection PR. Dependency maintenance entered through governed source, not
   by directly merging Dependabot PRs into the public projection.

The minimum supported topology is one human Owner, one Owner-Agent, one or more
bounded Operators, and a fresh Reviewer. On small projects one capable agent
may perform coordinator, dispatcher, and recorder roles sequentially, but a
Reviewer remains a distinct fresh context and no agent receives simultaneous
unbounded authority. External infrastructure, DNS, mail, hosting, and similar
Operators receive inert packets; repository mutation remains work-order bound.

## 17. Owner-authorized coordinator release and external-pilot sequence — 2026-08-31

The Owner rejected the inference that merging the coordinator's implementation
and maintenance PRs completed the roadmap. Public source now contains the
coordinator, but release `v0.8.1` predates it, no real external project has
completed the day-zero handoff, and the media/launch corpus remains stale after
the Writwall migration. The remaining sequence is:

1. **WO-WW-006 — COMPLETE: coordinator release readiness and external smoke
   gate.** Two independent 133-file public candidates reproduced byte-for-byte
   and passed the installed coordinator gate; the final Windows and native
   Ubuntu suites each passed 723 tests. Fresh review returned ACCEPT/HIGH and
   the Owner accepted the disclosed deviations. The separate `v0.9.0`
   publication decision remains unmade.
2. **External pilot A — `hllmr-media`.** After the release gate is accepted,
   move the current unversioned external media corpus to the truthful broader
   project identity, run `writwall start`, and exercise the complete
   handoff and adoption path on low-risk content operations.
3. **External pilot B — `hllmr-site`.** Recover from the abandoned partial
   bootstrap using a fresh session and the accepted coordinator packet. The
   repository Operator handles site bytes; the infrastructure Operator handles
   container, proxy, and deployment work only through a bounded external packet.
4. **Private infrastructure pilot — DNS and mail.** Create a private project for
   the eight-domain DNS move and Fastmail-to-Proton migration. Inventory and
   rollback design precede all external mutation; registrar, DNS, Proton, and
   mail-cleanup actions are separately dispatched and accepted.
5. **Post-pilot remediation and launch refresh.** Correct defects forced by the
   three external pilots, then update the media plan, launch kit, website, and
   Show HN copy to Writwall and to the evidence actually observed. Publication
   promotion does not precede that truth pass.

Release `v0.9.0` was published after WO-WW-006 closeout. External Pilot A then
began and stopped at its unratified handoff after exposing the bytecode-residue
defect governed by section 18. External Pilot B and the private DNS/mail pilot
remain queued intent, not active authority over their repositories or services.

## 18. First-use bytecode-residue correction — 2026-08-31

Release `v0.9.0` and External Pilot A exposed a first-use packaging defect:
under an ordinary Python environment, installation-created `__pycache__`
directories and `.pyc` files can be copied from the installed adoption bundle
into the generated bootstrap. The accepted release gate had masked this by
setting `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` for the complete smoke environment.

**WO-WW-007 is COMPLETE and accepted 2026-08-31.** Public issue #16 records the
sanitized defect. The work order reproduced it through the installed public
command, added public-interface regressions before each correction, made
coordinator output intrinsically cache-free, and made the external release gate
exercise ordinary user bytecode behavior on Windows and native Ubuntu. Fresh
review returned ACCEPT WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTE/HIGH confidence; the Owner accepted
that note and reported active minutes as NOT REPORTED.

The correction must now pass through the public projection/PR workflow and a
patch release before External Pilot A is regenerated from published bytes. The
regenerated topology keeps the human as Owner, the Owner-Agent as coordinator
and dispatcher, the repository agent as bounded Operator, and the existing
infrastructure agent behind a separate inert operations packet. Adoption of the
external project and content mutation remain separate decisions.

## 19. External Pilot A bootstrap-contract correction — 2026-08-31

External Pilot A reached the installed v0.9.1 birth test and exposed public
issue #22. The generated pre-adoption charter correctly forbids ordinary
mutation without an active work order, but the same absolute instruction made
a conforming provider refuse the exact Owner-ratified Level 1 expected-denial
probes before the installed hook could inspect them. Three provider sessions
were consumed without a complete birth test; no forbidden mutation succeeded
and no birth certificate is claimed.

**WO-WW-010 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: bootstrap expected-denial probe
contract.** Preserve the
ordinary no-pointer prohibition while defining one narrow engine-visible
bootstrap exception: an exact Owner-ratified birth-test lifecycle may direct
named probe attempts solely to falsify the wall, the attempts confer no
mutation authority, every valid outcome is denial, and any success stops the
adoption. Bind the coordinator handoff, adoption skill, adopter documentation,
adapter README copies, and executable generated-text regressions to the same
contract. After acceptance and publication through a separately authorized
patch release, regenerate only External Pilot A's affected bootstrap/adoption
material and repeat one fresh native Windows birth test. Media-content work,
website work, DNS/mail work, and other external mutation remain unauthorized.
Final governed-source Windows and Ubuntu suites each passed 735 tests; two
136-file public candidates were byte-identical; corrected fresh review returned
ACCEPT/HIGH.

## 20. v0.9.2 release identity — 2026-09-01

WO-WW-010 closed the bootstrap expected-denial contract and its private
closeout commit was pushed. The first authorized post-closeout public candidates
were independently checker-clean and byte-identical, but the executable release
gate correctly refused intended tag `v0.9.2` because package metadata and current
install/publication guidance still declared `v0.9.1`. Those invalid candidates
were deleted.

**WO-WW-011 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: v0.9.2 release identity.** Advance only the current
release identity across package metadata, installation and publication guidance,
and the executable release contract. Preserve truthful historical `v0.9.0` and
`v0.9.1` statements. After verification and acceptance, resume the already
authorized dual projection, fresh publication review, issue #22 PR, protected-CI
merge, `v0.9.2` release, and exactly one regenerated External Pilot A native
Windows birth test. No media-content, website, DNS, mail, or unrelated product
work is authorized.
Final Windows passed 735 tests; native Ubuntu passed the complete 13-test release
file; two 136-file candidates passed projection and installed-release checks and
were byte-identical; corrected fresh review returned ACCEPT/HIGH.

## 21. Installed bootstrap-bundle completeness — 2026-09-01

After WO-WW-011 closeout, two final 136-file public candidates passed the
existing projection and release gates and were byte-identical. Fresh publication
review blocked release: the wheel's exhaustive data-file map omitted
`skills/writwall-adopt/assets/bootstrap-charter-addendum.md`, and the release
gate did not enumerate that file while claiming a complete installed handoff.
Both invalid candidates were deleted; no public branch, PR, tag, release, or
pilot rerun occurred.

**WO-WW-012 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: installed bootstrap-bundle
completeness.** The existing canonical addendum is now packaged at the installed
path named by generated guidance, the release gate requires that exact path, and
executable tests prove both the complete installed handoff and deterministic
failure when the packaging entry is removed. Windows passed 738 tests with two
skips; Ubuntu passed the complete 16-test release file; two 136-file candidates
were projection/release-clean and byte-identical; corrected fresh review returned
ACCEPT/HIGH. Resume the authorized dual post-closeout projection, fresh
publication review, issue #22 PR, protected-CI merge, `v0.9.2` release, and one
External Pilot A Windows birth test. No other feature, media, website, DNS, mail,
or external work is active.

## 22. Post-closeout projection-reference truth — 2026-09-01

The first post-WO-WW-012 projection pair failed closed before release because
the new completed LOG record named an omitted private distribution path without
the required private-governed-source retained-reference qualifier. Both invalid
candidates were deleted and no public state changed.

**WO-WW-013 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: post-closeout
projection-reference truth.** The completed WO-WW-012 LOG record now carries the
exact same-line private-source qualifier required for its omitted path. The
unchanged checker also caught and removed an unnecessary repetition of that
literal from the issued Plan. Two final 136-file candidates passed projection
and installed `v0.9.2` release gates and were byte-identical; fresh review
returned ACCEPT/HIGH. Resume the authorized public release and External Pilot A
tail without changing product or checker bytes.

## 23. Public current-record host-path privacy — 2026-09-01

Fresh final publication review blocked the otherwise valid v0.9.2 candidate pair
because an earlier current-use Plan section retained a concrete host path to the
external media corpus. Existing gates rejected this machine's repository root
and human-supplied private patterns but did not reject a concrete sibling-project
path when the private profile omitted it. No public state changed.

**WO-WW-014 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: public current-record host-path
privacy.** The current-use Plan reference is host-neutral, and the independent
projection checker now rejects concrete Windows, macOS, Linux-home, and
mounted-drive paths in current public-facing records while preserving canonical
placeholders and historical evidence. Windows passed 743 tests with two skips;
the Windows and Ubuntu projection suites each passed 68 tests; two 136-file
candidates passed projection and installed `v0.9.2` release gates and were
byte-identical. Fresh corrected-record review returned ACCEPT/HIGH. Resume the
authorized public release and External Pilot A tail.

## 24. External Pilot A disposition and terminal lifecycle routing — 2026-09-01

Release `v0.9.2` is published. External Pilot A successfully adopted Writwall,
completed its channel-local Windows birth test, and closed two genuine work
orders with no successful forbidden mutation. That result remains a successful
adoption and operating result. Public issue #24 records one product lesson:
onboarding did not terminate at an explicit fresh Project-Architect boundary,
so the already-long adoption coordinator continued as Architect by
conversational momentum.

**WO-WW-015 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-01: terminal Architect handoff and
lifecycle-aware start routing.** `writwall start --project-root <project>` is
the sole human entry point. Clean/new projects retain interview and create-only
bootstrap; partial/recovery, adopted or retired lockout, and active-work-order
states skip intake and change no target bytes while routing to the correct
fresh role. Adoption closeout presents the exact fresh Owner-Agent / Project-
Architect handoff and stops before genuine project work.

Fresh Architect evidence added one interaction correction: lead with a concise
recommendation and material tradeoff, keep the complete packet as supporting
evidence, and ask once for a combined disposition and mechanically available
next action. When creating and dispatching a new user-owned task is that action,
the same request names it explicitly; permission is not inferred later. Once
approved, the Architect performs every mechanically available authorized step
without asking the same decision twice. Human ratification, work-order
activation boundaries, and distinct fresh review remain unchanged.

This correction authorizes no closeout, public mutation, release, pilot
mutation, external account access, or successor activation.

Final Windows verification passed 750 tests with two skips. Native Ubuntu
passed the affected lifecycle tests and the exact two installed-wheel tests
under a temporary compatible declared build backend. Two independent 136-file
public candidates were checker-clean and byte-identical. Fresh final re-review
returned **ACCEPT — HIGH confidence**. Owner active minutes were **NOT
REPORTED**. No successor work order is active; public issue #24 remains open
pending a separately authorized projection and PR.

## 25. v0.9.3 release identity — 2026-09-02

The first post-WO-WW-015 public candidates were independently checker-clean,
installed-release-clean, and byte-identical at 136 files. Fresh publication
review blocked them before any public branch or PR because immutable release
`v0.9.2` predates WO-WW-015 while current install guidance described the new
lifecycle behavior under that old tag. Both candidates were deleted.

**WO-WW-016 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-02: release identity 0.9.3.** Current
package metadata, conditional install guidance, and release-check commands now
agree on `0.9.3` / `v0.9.3` while explicitly stating that the tag is not yet
published. Truthful historical `v0.9.0` through `v0.9.2` evidence remains.

Windows passed 750 tests with two skips; native Ubuntu passed 17 release tests
and the installed `v0.9.3` gate. Two independent 136-file candidates passed
their Windows installed-release and final projection gates and were byte-
identical. Fresh review returned **ACCEPT — HIGH confidence**. Owner active
minutes were **NOT REPORTED**. After ordinary closeout, repeat two projections
and fresh publication review, open the issue #24 PR, and merge only after
required CI passes. Tagging and releasing `v0.9.3` remain separate,
unauthorized actions.

## 26. Post-v0.9.3 release truth and CI reliability — 2026-09-02

The Owner confirms that public `main` and release tag `v0.9.3` are both
`e0cef360843dff38d6a02dd48be8f61b2d2d300e`, the GitHub release is public,
its complete CI run passed, public issue #24 is closed, and no public pull
request remains open. The post-release governed-source record and current
install guidance must now be reconciled with those observed facts.

**WO-WW-017 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-02: post-release truth and CI
reliability.** Current guidance now truthfully identifies published v0.9.3;
the obsolete former-identity `dist/plumbline-0.6.zip` (private governed-source reference, not present in this candidate) was retired at Owner closeout;
Windows privacy-profile replacement contention has a bounded classified retry;
and pull-request heads execute one complete matrix without duplicate push
jobs. Windows passed 752 tests with two skips, the native Ubuntu affected set
passed with one platform skip, and fresh review returned **ACCEPT — HIGH
confidence** after two correction cycles. Public issues #18 and #19 proceed
through the authorized post-closeout projection, review, and protected-CI PR.
No release or external-project mutation is authorized.

## 27. CI recovery and onboarding correction sequence — 2026-09-02

The first protected-CI run for the accepted WO-WW-017 public projection passed
fourteen of fifteen jobs and exposed a Python 3.14 race in the Windows
contention-test harness. Public issue #27 records the failure. The Owner
authorized correction rather than an unexplained rerun.

1. **WO-WW-018 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-02: Python 3.14
   contention-test race.** The observation handshake now publishes atomically,
   tolerates present-but-incomplete state within a bounded wait, and guarantees
   helper reaping and stream closure without weakening real Windows contention
   or product assertions. Native Windows Python 3.14 focused tests and 20 stress
   iterations passed; a clean prospective tree passed 753 tests with two skips
   and every repository gate. Fresh independent execution returned **ACCEPT
   WITH NON-BLOCKING POLISH / high confidence**. Two independent 136-file
   projections were byte-identical, fresh publication review returned ACCEPT,
   and all fifteen public CI matrix jobs passed, including Windows/Python 3.14.
   Public PR #26 merged at `92846c03f60303efd9f0e2fc14a99bbca2e1daea`;
   issues #18, #19, and #27 are closed.
2. **WO-WW-019 — COMPLETE: External Pilot B lifecycle classification.** A clean
   external pilot with draft/unratified adoption records was classified as
   retired lockout. The accepted correction now requires complete affirmative
   Appendix D evidence, preserves established and alternate ratified records,
   rejects unrelated/malformed/contradictory evidence, and exercises the rule
   through the installed-wheel release gate. Public issue #28 remains the
   sanitized defect record; External Pilot B stays frozen pending separate
   authorization after the remaining coordinator corrections.
3. **WO-WW-020 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-03: Canonical project-root
   enforcement.** Generated repository and external-Operator packets name one
   resolved canonical root and prohibit shadow repositories and durable temp
   state. Nested Git-worktree paths stop before bootstrap mutation; non-Git,
   linked-worktree-root, and lifecycle routes remain compatible. Windows and
   native Ubuntu installed-wheel sets each passed 80/80; fresh review returned
   ACCEPT with no substantive blocker; the final closeout suite passed 772
   tests with two expected skips.
4. **WO-WW-021 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-03: Conversation-first inception
   and existing-project continuity.** The ordinary installed command now opens
   a nonblocking Architect conversation from one project root. Existing Git
   repositories receive bounded high-level observations; empty targets open
   with one unconstrained invitation. Structured and non-interactive routes
   remain compatible. Owner / Architect / General / Operator / Reviewer roles,
   lifecycle routing, canonical-root controls, and the installed-wheel release
   gate are synchronized. Final Windows and native Ubuntu affected sets each
   passed 90/90, the closeout suite passed 782 tests with two expected skips,
   and fresh review returned ACCEPT with no remaining defect.

The conversational path is not capped at three questions or any fixed turn
count. Fast first value is the target; useful inquiry may continue. Existing
`writwall start --project-root ...` automation and lifecycle-aware behavior
remain backward-compatible. The public on-ramp must make the simple path
obvious without removing the detailed manual and recovery routes.

## 28. Conversation-first public release — 2026-09-03

**WO-WW-022 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-03: publish v0.10.0.** Accepted
WO-WW-019 through
WO-WW-021 as the first public conversation-first release. Advance current
release identity coherently to `0.10.0` / `v0.10.0`, preserve historical
release truth, pass Windows and native Ubuntu installed-candidate gates, build
two byte-identical privacy-screened public candidates, obtain fresh review,
and publish only through protected public CI. Final source and candidate suites
passed; a first fresh review correctly returned generated cache residue, and a
corrected fresh re-review returned **ACCEPT — HIGH confidence** after removal,
full rerun, and two-platform candidate evidence. Public issue #29 records the
release gap. The authorized post-closeout PR/CI/tag/release lifecycle remains
in progress; External Pilot B resumes only from the verified immutable release.

## 29. External Pilot B read-only entry and release-integrity corrections — 2026-09-03

The first v0.10.0 passes over `hllmr-site` and `hllmr-infra` independently
exposed the same coordinator boundary: lifecycle-derived routing provides no
explicit, repository-nonmutating fresh-Architect entry for an incomplete or
already-adopted project. Both pilots also observed that GitHub reports v0.10.0
as non-immutable. Public issues #31 and #32 preserve the sanitized findings.
The separate PyYAML dependency belongs to `hllmr-site`, not Writwall, and is
routed in that repository's issue #1.

**WO-WW-024 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-03: read-only role entry and release integrity.** Added a
backward-compatible `writwall inspect` interface with explicit lifecycle-safe
Architect, General, recovery, and auto routing; prove it creates no repository,
temporary, profile, privacy, cache, or bytecode state; and add offline
published-release metadata verification requiring a matching immutable
release. Document v0.10.0's actual non-immutable status and the Owner-enabled
prospective GitHub control without rewriting history. Fresh review rejected
three first-pass overclaims; corrected final bytes execute no subprocess from
`inspect`, bound release metadata reads to a non-link regular file, and state
that v0.10.0 predates the new command. Corrected review returned ACCEPT/HIGH;
104 focused and 796 full tests passed. No version bump, public projection,
release, or external-project mutation occurred.

## 30. Read-only role-entry release — 2026-09-04

**WO-WW-025 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-04: publish v0.11.0 with one
canonical onboarding lifecycle.** The Owner accepted the initial
release qualification, then identified before retirement that README,
START-HERE, and ADOPTING still mixed the accepted conversation-first lifecycle
with a superseded three-route model. Amendment 2 preserves the qualified
`writwall inspect` and immutable-release work while synchronizing the public
entry surfaces around Owner → fresh Architect → explicit promotion and
adoption → fresh General → bounded Operators and fresh review. It must give
workplace and existing-project users exact commands, prompts, provider truth,
and external-Operator boundaries. Amendment 3 corrects the discovered
executable structured/non-interactive route so every clean/new mode reaches
the fresh Architect and promotion gate before adoption mechanics. Prove the
contract across both native platforms and two public candidates, and receive
fresh review and renewed Owner acceptance before closeout or publication. Both
amendments passed those gates and the Owner accepted the corrected result.
Truthful v0.10.0 history remains. The authorized v0.11.0 public lifecycle
follows closeout.

## 31. Public-distribution inspection and ledger correction — 2026-09-04

**WO-WW-026 — COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-04.** The final publication review found
that projected source-adoption records incorrectly selected a General for the
public distribution itself, and a test helper used a different digest order
from the publication specification. Correct these bounded defects, preserve
existing lifecycle safety checks, add Windows/Ubuntu regressions, and qualify
two public candidates with fresh review. Then resume the authorized v0.11.0
publication and pilot handoffs. Public issue #33 records the defect.

Owner Amendment 1 extends this order to distinguish four preserved historical
naming decisions from current naming evidence. Preserve every evidence byte
and timestamp, validate historical decisions within their recorded windows,
and retain current-time freshness for all new naming decisions. Repeat release
verification and fresh review before the pending publication lifecycle.

The Owner accepted the corrected implementation and Amendment 1 with the
disclosed diagnostics. Windows ran 810 tests with two skips; native Ubuntu's
public candidate ran 810 with four skips, both OK. Two 136-file candidates
passed distribution and installed gates on both platforms and matched exactly.
Independent implementation and record reviews returned ACCEPT. Owner active
minutes: NOT REPORTED. Resume the authorized post-closeout projections, fresh
publication review, protected-CI PR/merge, immutable v0.11.0 release, and pilot
handoffs; external project mutation is not part of this closeout.

## 32. Scoped authorization continuity — 2026-09-14

Owner ratification: "Approved, proceed", recorded before materialization in
`governance/history/WO-WW-027-issuance-lifecycle.md` (private governed-source reference, not present in this candidate).

Queue one bounded correction to existing approval-continuity guidance: preserve
and expose the source, limits and delegation scope of an already-approved
action in generated handoffs. Distinguish missing Owner decisions from provider
permission failures. Do not create an authority service, expand delegation,
amend Doctrine, or promise mechanical control over agent conversation. Issues
36-38 remain proposals, not authorized implementation successors.

**WO-WW-027 COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-14**, including the disclosed deviations.
Generated handoffs now carry scoped approval evidence and distinguish missing
authority from provider/environment blockers. Native Windows affected gates ran
120 tests with two symlink-privilege skips; Ubuntu ran all 120. Fresh Sonnet
conformance review passed with ten passing synthetic scenarios. No real-world
operating-cost improvement is claimed. Closeout permits one private commit;
issue 35 remains open until a separately authorized public delivery.

## 33. Compact evidence-linked continuation brief — 2026-09-14

Authorize WO-WW-028 for public issue #36: add an opt-in, zero-write compact
continuation brief to existing inspection. Link authoritative evidence and
distinguish observed facts, human decisions, proposals, required inputs,
optional references, and next permitted action or exact blocker. Do not
infer approval, retrieve closed history, introduce telemetry, alter role
eligibility, or replace mandatory evidence with a summary. Verify source
and installed behavior on Windows and Ubuntu with fresh review. Issues
#37 and #38 remain proposals; no release or adopter migration is authorized.

**WO-WW-028 COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-15**, including disclosed deviations
and coverage limits. Opt-in compact inspection and its installed-wheel gate
are implemented. Windows affected suites ran 133 tests, OK with four skips;
Ubuntu ran 133, OK without skips. Fresh Sonnet review: ACCEPT / HIGH.
Ordinary closeout and one private commit/push are authorized. Public delivery
and issue #36 closure require separate authorization; #37/#38 stay proposals.

## 34. Bounded operational preflight — 2026-09-16

Owner authorized proceeding with issue #37 after clean-lockout verification.
WO-WW-029 extends existing external-operation packets with task-scoped inventory
of relevant alternate writers, execution engines, schedulers, access limits,
evidence age, rollback and the last safe stop before operational execution.
Keep unknown distinct from absent. Permit planning while affected execution
remains blocked. Ordinary local coding receives no infrastructure questionnaire.
Preserve existing intake compatibility and repository/infrastructure authority
separation. Synthetic source and installed tests only; no real host discovery.
Role realignment and implementation provenance remain separate proposals.

**WO-WW-029 COMPLETE, accepted 2026-09-16**, including disclosed deviations
and the non-blocking documentation-pinning suggestion. Explicit optional
operational classification now elicits bounded inventory without imposing
an infrastructure questionnaire on local work. Windows affected suites:
141 tests OK, four skips; native Ubuntu: 141 tests OK, no skips, including
real installed-wheel gates. Fresh distinct Sonnet review: CONFORMANCE PASS.
Owner active minutes NOT REPORTED. Ordinary closeout and one private local
commit authorized; no push, public projection, PR, release or adopter change.
Issue #37 remains open pending separately authorized public delivery.
Issues #38 and #41 remain proposals; no successor is activated. The Reviewer
suggested future documentation-pinning coverage; it is not new authorized work.
