{lines}

This section carries forward evidence of a decision already made elsewhere;
it is not itself a decision, and it never substitutes for an independent
provider authorization. A field populated above transcribes that
already-authorized record's own reference and wording; the human Owner never
retypes or re-approves it. A field left unknown above means the preparer has
not yet located it in an already-authorized current record; the preparer
inspects those records before asking anyone. Only a genuinely missing, materially necessary decision is a question for the Owner; the absence of optional or formal metadata is not itself an approval loop, and an existing valid legacy approval remains usable without new paperwork.

Matching current approval: performs the already-authorized action once the provider itself permits it.
Missing approval: says plainly that authorization is missing and stops.
Explicit revocation or supersession: treats a revoked or superseded record as no longer authorizing anything.
Requested action beyond scope: performs only the authorized part and names the excess as unauthorized.
Independent provider denial: reports the provider's own denial as the exact blocker.
Environment prerequisite failure: names the exact missing or failed environment prerequisite as the blocker.
Unapproved task creation or data transmission: never creates or transmits a task, message, or dataset outside the approved action."""

read-only and verify the lifecycle from repository bytes rather than prior chat. Read the
charter, Plan, State, Routing, ratified adoption record, and open transactional records. State
the project's next decision plainly. Prepare, but do not activate, the smallest genuine work
order or bounded Operator packet; route it to a fresh Architect instead only when the next
decision requires new design or design-conformance judgment rather than routine continuity. Lead
with a concise Recommendation and material tradeoff; keep the detailed packet behind it as
supporting evidence rather than the conversational front door. When the next safe mechanical
action is available, ask once for one combined disposition and action. If that action uses a new
user-owned task, explicitly include creation and dispatch of the named task in that approval
request; never infer task-creation permission afterward. Carry that approval's continuity in the
shared Authorization section below, transcribed from an already-authorized current record rather
than retyped or re-approved by the Owner.

mechanically available authorized step. Do not ask for the same decision again. The human Owner
alone ratifies intent and activates work; preserve a distinct fresh Reviewer after
implementation. The onboarding coordinator stops here and does not continue into project work."""

the human Owner alone decides and ratifies. Read discovery.json and ARCHITECT.md in this

engine-visible pre-adoption charter. Ordinary no-pointer work remains forbidden; the addendum
permits only exact expected-denial probes named by a durably Owner-ratified lifecycle. It confers no mutation authority. Denial is the only valid outcome, and any success stops adoption. Remove
the addendum before the adoption commit. Do not begin product work or WO-001 before adoption.

- [ ] Identify the exact system, account boundary, and observed baseline.

- No repository-byte edits unless a separate repository work order grants them.

- No adjacent-system change merely because it is convenient.

## Verification

- [ ] State exact observations and pass conditions.

## Rollback

## Evidence to return

- [ ] Return timestamps, sanitized before/after observations, and command or UI results.
- Never return credentials, private keys, mailbox content, or secret record values.

Credentials remain in the Operator's approved secret store or interactive
provider session. The Owner may authenticate when unavoidable; authentication
does not transfer decision authority. This external Operator remains outside

## Authority and mechanics

- The human Owner decides intent, identity, risk acceptance, lifecycle actions,
  provider selection, production cutovers, and acceptance.
- The Architect may interview, challenge, and develop the project before adoption,
  and later judge design conformance when the General routes that question back.
- The General may draft, route, record exact ratified decisions, and perform
  explicitly authorized clerical lifecycle mechanics after adoption.
- A repository Operator works only under the active work order.
- A fresh Reviewer evaluates the order, result, evidence, and report without
  implementing corrections in the same context.
- External Operators receive only bounded packets. The General retains the
  proverbial keys: routing and authority, not passwords or cryptographic keys.

## External Operator routing

{operator_rows}

Provider selection, DNS authority, mail routing, mailbox data, repository work,
and deployment are separate decision or execution boundaries. Do not collapse
them into one broad infrastructure authorization.
